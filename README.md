# Interactive Squiggle Kit

I've set this repository up as a publically available contribution project that will continue to evolve over time.

### Art Blocks Chromie Squiggle ~ 3d print + LED lights

Want to 3d print your Art Blocks Chromie Squiggle? Want to add glowing lights? This fun iterative kit allows you to bring digital and physical artwork together. A fun experimental project with a general goal of a physical object that, when touched, can display interactive LED light animations that match the Chromie Squiggle number.

Simple and easily identifiable, each squiggle embodies the soul of the Art Blocks platform. Consider each my personal signature as an artist, developer, and tinkerer. Public minting of the Chromie Squiggle is permanently paused. They are now reserved for manual distribution to collectors and community members over a longer period of time. Please visit OpenSea to explore Squiggles available on the secondary market.

### 3D Printing

Note: 3D asset was quickly created as an example. Updates will be made to improve the model.
